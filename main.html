  <!-- Paragraph -->
  <p>
    I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems, building creative solutions, and continuously learning new technologies. The ability to create software that can make people's lives easier and more efficient motivates me to improve my skills every day. I believe software development gives me the opportunity to combine logic with creativity, and that balance inspires me to grow in this field.
